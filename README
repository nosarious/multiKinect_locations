MultiKinect Locations is the start of a project ot allow people to use multiple kinects for installations. For our purposes the kinects were hung above the projection space, pointing downwards, and identifying where people were along the wall. Our system used 6 kinects to get coverage over a thirty foot distance, between 4080 pixels wide (triplehead2go on macbook) and 5760 (direct video feeds from a desktop computer system)

Due to the nature of the usb requirements for kinects, the macbook could only ever see two devices. The desktop system was able to work with the complete 6. We discovered that each kinect needs it's own controller for the usb. Our desktop had three on the motherboard, and an additional three usb3 pci cards.

This program has a simple format. Each kinects gets a kleft number which is used to identify it within a certain space. At first you identify each kinect by placign an object underneath it, and then use the number keys and keys directly below them to identify which one moves. The silhouette is built from the point cloud, and the number of kleft is identified for each kinect along the wall. Once the silhouette lines up with the object, that number is confirmed and the next can be found.
